    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe will show you how to make a SINGULAR tortilla chip. Please do not ask how to make multiple chips; the technology is not quite there yet to produce en masse and the last time someone attempted to utilize this recipe for multiple chips, a 10 mile sinkhole was created and the land is now uninhabitable for the next 600 years.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>corn, or as the native americans called it, maize</li>
        <li>rock or something</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>donkey</li>
        <li>two bottles of tequila (with optional worm)</li>
        <li>tomato (NOT OPTIONAL!!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>find a cow and ask him to point you in the direction of a corn field (you may ask the same cow that assisted you with the <a href="burger.html">burger recipe</a>)</li>
        <li>throw salt at the cow to remind him that you're coming for him soon</li>
        <li>journey thru the valleys and desert; drink the tequila to give you liquid courage for when the little chihuahuas start barking at you</li>
        <li>Use the rock to bash open the padlock on the back of the cornfield's fence</li>
        <li>C O N S U M E</li>
    </ol>
